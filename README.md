# Realms Weather WordPress Widget 

A simple daily weather WordPress Widget for the Forgotten Realms, specifically the city of Waterdeep, using the Third Edition Forgotten Realms Campaign setting publication year to set the Forgotten Realms year.  Icons are from https://www.deviantart.com/azuresol/art/Sketcy-Weather-Icons-Glow-ed-135079488

## Features

* Fun!  This is strictly for fun and entirely non-canonical
* The year is based on the published year from the Forgotten Realms supplements.  It may be off or not your current campaign year.  Feel free to edit to suit!
* Free!  I offer this to you for free.  Please use it as you will and enjoy!
* Also, please give credit where credit is due.  If you make something more of this, please, link back to this code, as sloppy as it is.

## Usage

The WordPress Widget Boilerplate is ready to activate as-is (and it includes a sample widget with a title, content, and checkbox).

1. Copy the `RealmsWeatherWidget` directory into your `wp-content/plugins` directory
2. Navigate to the "Plugins" dashboard page
3. Locate the menu item that reads "Realms Weather WordPress Widget"
4. Click on "Activate"

You may need to place that widget on your sidebar, if you don't have it set to automatically add activated widgets.
